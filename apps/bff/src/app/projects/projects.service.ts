        company: 'WARTOWN is Steve Holcomb and Mike Yurgalavage, two long-time friends who have played music in one form or another for nearly 25 years. Formerly performing simply as "Steve and Mike", they have pushed themselves to grow and expand their shows, striving to increase their audiences and playing in new venues. The name WARTOWN is also the \'nickname\' of their home-town city, Warner Robins, Georgia. Their sound can best be described as \'Powered Acoustic\' and they strive to be a little different in their approach to music, especially the acoustic genre. Technically speaking, they are an \'acoustic duo\', but at one of their shows you will quickly realize that their sound is much bigger than you expected, with backing basslines, percussion, and various other instruments too numerous to count. It\'s hard to believe all of that sound and 4800 watts of energy is coming from only 2 people. With a performance list of over 100 songs, their palette of covers runs through a deep variety of artists and styles. Well known in the middle Georgia area for their fun and interactive performances, they have quickly become a staple of the Warner Robins music scene. You might hear them play anything from blues, country, rock, southern rock, pop, R&B, to hip hop (yes a \'Wartown\' form of acoustic hip-hop) that will be those songs that are very familiar to audiences, punctuated with surprise song combinations (Stain\'d mixed with Gnarls Barkley, Led Zeppelin mixed with Marshall Tucker, John Mayer mixed with Ludacris, etc.) that keep audiences looking and listening for more. Often playing for 3 or 4 hours with no breaks, their shows are a non-stop, musical experience not to be missed.',
