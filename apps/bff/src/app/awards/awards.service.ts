It\'s only the passive observers of life who say "I\'ll believe it when I see it." We take the opposite approach, and lead with our hearts and minds. We know the truth: If we truly believe in something, we can – and will – affect the outcome. If we believe in ourselves first, we dramatically increase our odds of success. If we believe it can happen, then it will.',
